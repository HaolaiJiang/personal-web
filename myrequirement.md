I am trying to build a website for my personal use. I want to have a static website with a modern design. I want to have a blog section, a project section, and a contact section. This website is a example of what I want to build. Here is the link to the website:https://tuwang.ai/ I don't like the color scheme. I don't need the podcast section. I want to have a github repo for this project to track the changes. I think my blog posts should be in markdown format and uploaded to github. right? You don't have to use the same framework as tuwang.ai. Please select the framework that you think is the best for this project. I want to add Google Analytics to the website so I can track the traffic and user behavior. I don't have a domain name yet. I want to use a free domain name. Later I can buy a domain name. I am willing to pay a little fees if there is a good reason. Can you first generate a detailed plan for this project?
