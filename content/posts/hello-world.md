# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! This is a sample post written in Markdown.

## Why I built this site

I wanted a place to share my thoughts and projects. I chose **Next.js** because it's fast, flexible, and I love React.

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- TypeScript

Stay tuned for more updates!
