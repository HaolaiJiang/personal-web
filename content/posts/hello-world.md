<!-- # Welcome! My Name is Lincoln -->

Hello, this is Lincoln, I chose this name as my American name out of admiration for President Lincoln. As a Data Scientist at Amazon, I spend my days analyzing massive datasets to optimize supply chain performance. I have been thinking about building a personal website for a while, and finally decided to do it now. Thanks GenAI, it is relatively easy to build a website now. I will share my thoughts about stock trading, my personal projects, and my thoughts on life.

If you are interested, let's ride the wave together!

Keep tuned for more updates!
